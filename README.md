# HandWritten Digit Recognition
The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying handwritten
digits from the MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0
to 9. The challenge lies in training a model that can effectively capture the subtle variations in writing
styles across different individuals while maintaining robustness to noise and distortions in the images.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning, particularly for
image classification tasks. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) collected
from various sources. 
* The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

# GNN Visualization
* Connectivity Visualization: Visualizing the connectivity of pixels forming a digit
using the GNN model can provide qualitative insights into how the model processes
and understands image data.
